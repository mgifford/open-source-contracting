## 15.0 DATA RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP OF DELIVERABLES

The specific terms and conditions governing data rights and ownership of deliverables shall be specified in each respective task order under this BPA. The remaining subparagraphs in this
section 15.0 are provided as guidelines for ordering officials to consider incorporating, when possible and as appropriate, into the ordering official’s task order under this BPA.
It is GSA’s intent that any data or deliverable created as a result of a task order under this BPA be committed to the public domain.

Contracting Officers are encouraged to designate in task orders the following items as property of GSA with the intention of committing the items to the public domain: all data, documents,
graphics and code created under this BPA including but not limited to, plans, reports, schedules, schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the like; new open source software created by the
Contractor and forks or branches of current open source software where the Contractor has made a modification; new tooling, scripting configuration management, infrastructure as code, or any
other final changes or edits to successfully deploy or operate the software.

If commercial software is required as part of the contractor’s delivery of professional services, then the ordering official shall include the appropriate FAR or applicable agency supplemental
clause(s).

The contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible, in support of the 18F Source Code Policy. All licenses must be expressly listed in the deliverable. Regardless of
12 license(s) used (e.g., MIT, GPL, Creative Commons 0) the license(s) shall be clearly listed in the
documentation.

If the contractor needs to use work that does not have an open source license, the contractor is required to request permission from 18F, in writing, before utilizing that work in any way in
connection with the task order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a conspicuous place when work is delivered to 18F.

If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the contractor shall ensure compliance with that guidance. If implementation guidance is not available, the contractor shall
attach or include the license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a software repository.

Contracting Officers may consider requiring the contractor to place a copyright waiver on materials, documents, deliverables, etc., developed during the performance of a task order. See Attachment D boilerplate template

## 24.0 EVALUATION AND BASIS FOR AWARD

### A. NON-PRICE FACTORS:

Pool One Design: In addition to the Description, above, the Quoter must demonstrate that they followed the U.S. Digital Services Playbook by providing evidence in the repository. The README.md file should also make reference to the following for Pool One design:
  a. assigned one leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
  b. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum three of the labor categories limited to the Design Pool Labor categories to design the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services.
  c. understand what people need, by including people (see note #1) in the prototype design process
  d. used at least three “human-centered design” techniques or tools
  e. created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library
  f. used at least three modern (see Note#2) and open source frontend or client side (see note
  g. performed usability tests with people
  h. used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
  i. created a prototype that works on multiple devices and presents a responsive design
  j. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
  k. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.

**Notes:** (#1) The government understands it will be difficult to find people who would be credible actual users of the prototype, given the dataset. “People” here is to be understood as anyone not
directly involved in the design or development of the prototype. Subsequent use of the word “People” in all the criteria should be understood to have the same definition as described in this
footnote.

(#2) “Modern” is to be understood as any technology or standard released, created, initiated or finalized in the 5 years preceding the release of this RFQ. Any subsequent use of the word
“Modern” in these criteria is to be understood as having the same definition as described in this note.

(#3) Either term, frontend or client-side is meant to be understood as a code that is executed within a user-agent, most commonly in this context a web browser.

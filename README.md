# Open-source Contracting

Problem: Many institutions use open-source software but the procurement process generally restricts collaboration and participation. By adding these elements to boiler-plate contracts we hope that we can encourage better practices that support more effective engagement with the community that builds/maintains the code.

# Principals
- By default all work will be under an open license. Where possible adopt the license of the parent project. 
- External contractors will work with internal IT staff where possible to exchange knowledge & transfer responsibilities.
- Any proprietary software licenses will need to give explicit approval before they can be used.
- Code developed should be releasable if it serves the needs of the broader community.
- Collaboration is never easy. However, if it is stated as one of the intended outcomes it is more likely to happen.
- When evaluating tech solutions contractors will be encouraged to enhance existing modules, rather than build from scratch. Enhancements would be pushed upstream to improve the solutions for everyone.
- Patches to existing modules will be contributed in the project's issue queue (ie. https://www.drupal.org/project/issues)

# Open-source Contracting #

Problem: Many institutions use open-source software but the procurement process generally restricts collaboration and participation. By adding these elements to boiler-plate contracts we hope that we can encourage better practices that support more effective engagement with the community that builds/maintains the code.

## Principals ##
- By default all work will be under an open license. Where possible adopt the license of the parent project. 
- External contractors will work with internal IT staff where possible to exchange knowledge & transfer responsibilities.
- Any proprietary software licenses will need to give explicit approval before they can be used.
- Code developed should be releasable if it serves the needs of the broader community.
- Collaboration is never easy. However, if it is stated as one of the intended outcomes it is more likely to happen.
- When evaluating tech solutions contractors will be encouraged to enhance existing modules, rather than build from scratch. Enhancements would be pushed upstream to improve the solutions for everyone.
- Patches to existing modules will be contributed in the project's issue queue (ie. https://www.drupal.org/project/issues)
- Client must be informed if any customizations to Core or Contributed Modules will cause problems with upgrades.

##Contribution vs Contracting##

There are many open-source projects which take on contributions and so therefore need an agreement for the license of those contributions. The Fedora Project of RedHat came up with this [Fedora Project Contributor Agreement](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement?rd=Legal:FPCA) as a model. 

Many contracts however are for larger pieces of work and not descrete code checkins that are tied to an already existing open-source project.  

## Sample language ##

All software we develop through this contract will be the copyright of [Company X] and licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL) to ensure that the software may be freely used, modified and distributed. Any documentation provided by [Company X] will be similarly licensed under the Creative Commons Share-alike License.
